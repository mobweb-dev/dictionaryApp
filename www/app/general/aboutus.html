                    <h2>WHAT IS LÉA KNOWS?</h2>
                    <p>The best way to learn the local language. <br>Ever looked up a word in the dictionary only to
                        forget it five minutes later? It happened to me all the time! That is why I created Léa Knows. With
                        Léa Knows, every word that you look up in the dictionary will be automatically recorded for you
                        to practise later using flashcards. It's that simple. And by practising with flashcards, you
                        will master the local language in no time!</p>

                    <h2>WHO IS LÉA?</h2>
                    <p>My daughter. I am French, my wife is Taiwanese (Chinese speaker), we communicate in English and
                        live in Barcelona, where they speak Spanish and Catalan. That is 5 languages right there, so I
                        thought it would be fitting to name this app after her.</p>
                    <h2>WHO IS BEHIND THIS APP?</h2>
                    <p>My name is Sébastien Marion. When I arrived in Spain in 2014 I was frustrated by how slow my language skills were improving: whenever I translated a word, I forgot it after five minutes. I thought that
                        learning a language should be easier than this, and this is why I created Léa Knows.</p>
                    <p>You can find more about me on my personal site at <a href="https://www.sebmarion.com" class="white">https://www.sebmarion.com</a></p>
